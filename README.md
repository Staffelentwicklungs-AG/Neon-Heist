# Neon-Heist<br/>
This game prototype was developed as part of a weekly student project within a game development training program. Each student group explores a different core mechanic inspired by modern AAA games but scaled down to fit a beginner-friendly scope using the Unity Engine (2D or 3D).<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to help students learn essential development workflows such as:<br/>
  -Scripting<br/>
  -Scene building<br/>
  -Asset integration<br/>
  -UI and UX basics<br/>
  -Simple game logic<br/>
<br/>
Each prototype features a unique gameplay twist (USP) and focuses on one specific mechanic or idea.<br/>
Inspired by: Hitman / Deus Ex<br/>
Genre: 3D Stealth Game<br/>
USP: The player must steal a valuable artifact without being spotted. Vision cones and lighting play a key role.<br/>
Main focus: Line-of-sight detection, lighting effects, stealth mechanics.<br/>
gameplay: the player slips into the role of a space pirate who breaks into large merchant freighters in the distant future to steal valuable artifacts and items. to help him, he has a pair of sup-a-vision goggles. with these goggles, the player can recognize hidden lasers and traps. however, they are not infinite and must be recharged with data packs. these data packs can be found throughout the levels. in addition, there are different types of enemies in the levels, all of which have their own abilities.<br/>
